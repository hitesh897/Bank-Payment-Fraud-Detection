# Bank-Payment-Fraud-Detection
Problem Description :
With the increasing use of online payment systems and digital transactions, the risk of 
payment fraud has become a significant concern for banks and financial institutions. 
Detecting fraudulent transactions accurately and efficiently is crucial to protect 
customers and prevent financial losses.
The Bank Payment Fraud Detection project aims to develop a machine learning solution 
to identify fraudulent payment transactions from a given dataset. The dataset contains 
various features related to each transaction, such as the transaction amount, category, 
age of the account holder, and other relevant information. The target variable is a binary 
label indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).
Dataset Information: The dataset used for this project contains records of payment 
transactions, where each transaction is represented as a row and each feature as a 
column. The dataset includes the following columns:
1. 'amount': The amount of money involved in the transaction.
2. 'age': The age of the account holder making the transaction.
3. 'category': The category of the payment transaction.
4. 'zipcodeOri': The originating zip code of the payment.
5. 'zipMerchant': The zip code of the merchant where the payment is made.
6. 'fraud': The target variable indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or 
not (0).


Background Information: Payment fraud occurs when unauthorized and deceptive 
transactions are made with the intention to deceive financial institutions and exploit 
account holders. Fraudsters employ various techniques to mask their activities and 
evade detection, making it challenging for banks to identify fraudulent transactions.
Machine learning algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest Classifier, 
and XGBoost, can be utilized to analyze transaction patterns, identify anomalies, and 
predict fraudulent transactions accurately. These algorithms can learn from historical 
data, enabling them to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent transactions based 
on their distinct characteristics.
By leveraging machine learning techniques, banks and financial institutions can enhance 
their fraud detection capabilities, minimize losses, and safeguard their customers' 
financial interests. Accurate fraud detection also helps to maintain trust in digital 
payment systems and promotes a secure and reliable financial environment
